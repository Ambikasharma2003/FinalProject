                            Test Analysts are not as one-dimensional as one would think. It is a profession that requires much more than computer skills. Test Analysts have to be big-picture thinkers, yet they also must have an above average attention to detail. Identifying the source of a bug can be as small as a single error in one line of code. They have to have to be able to see the big picture of a project in order to develop tests that can find these small errors. In addition to their technical skills, Test Analysts must have certain soft skills to excel at their job. The following sections are a collection of skills we found to be most prominent in our analysis of Test Analyst job descriptions.
