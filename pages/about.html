                <h2>Background</h2>
                <p>
                    The field of information systems (IS) encompasses more than technology. It considers people,
                    hardware, software, processes, and data. The focus of information systems is to add value to
                    organizations and provide them the means to be competitive. It is a fantastic field and young
                    professionals may not be aware of what it entails or may not know where to start as it encompasses
                    various technologies and theory.
                </p>
            </section>
            <section class="mt-5 mx-3">
                <h2>Value of Website</h2>
                <p>
                    The purpose of the website is to provide visitors with information regarding careers in the IS field
                    and pertinent information such as responsibilities, average pay, required skills, recommended
                    learning materials, and a small sample of job postings. In addition, it aims at providing visitors a
                    clearer understanding of what IS entails. This information is particularly useful to individuals who
                    are interested in technology and business but may not know where to start searching for information.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The process of exploring what careers are available within the field; pertinent information about
                    these careers; and learning materials as it pertains to software technologies requires one to
                    traverse various websites. A quick Google search for “information systems careers” produces several
                    pages in which only a quick summary of a job is provided. For example, a blog by Baker college lists
                    several roles e.g., Business Analyst, Computer Systems Analyst, Data Analyst, with a summary of the
                    role (Baker College, 2021). Similarly, a web page by the University of Nevada, Reno provides several
                    jobs with only a summary (University of Nevada, n.d.). These sites only provide a description of the
                    role without much detail.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Moreover, individuals looking for job postings for a specific IS career will need to first identify
                    available careers and then search for jobs on sites where they are posted. Sites where jobs are
                    posted do not tailor to IS careers. Instead, users need to search various jobs based on specific
                    keywords. Therefore, these sites assume visitors may search using IS as a keyword or know the
                    specific career titles. For example, Careers.govt.nz is a site where individuals can search for
                    jobs. Upon landing on the home page, visitors are not provided with any text that guides them
                    towards looking for careers in IS. The same can be said about websites such as Indeed and Monster.
                    Visitors are likely to search for IT which will provide them with some relevant jobs; however, some
                    of these sites will
                    require that they visit various websites to obtain additional information about the career.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This iteration of the website contains limited information tailored for individuals who
                    possess limited knowledge of IS and pertinent careers.
